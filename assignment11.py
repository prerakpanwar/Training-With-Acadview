#Q1.What is access token? Generate access token for any API.


Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.
An access token is a unique string of letters and numbers that we pass with every API call.
Each access token is associated with:
   - API application.
   - The user we are acting on behalf of (for merchants, etc).
   - The permissions our app has for that user.
Access Token for twitter via JWT online generator:

#Q4.Difference Between Library & API


               LIBRARY                                                       |                   API
                                                                             |
1-A library is a collection of code built to perform common tasks            |  1-API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code .
2-Library is written in same language which in which it is used              |  2-API can be written in any language
3-Library code tends to be relatively stable and bug free.                   |  3-APIs should be defined before the code implementing them is implemented. 
4-Use of appropriate libraries can reduce the amount of code the need to be  |  4-APIs should be stable, although portions of the API can be deprecated 
  written. It will tend to reduce line of code counts for an application     |  5-The more broadly used the API the more difficult it is to change it.
  will increasing the rate at which functionality is delivered.              |  6-e.g. Google Maps API for JavaScript, flickrj is API for Flickr in JAVA
5-Usually, it's better to use a library routine than to write own code.      |         tweepy is an API for Twitter, spotipy is an API for Spotify
6-e.g. Numpy is a library of Python for matrices & mathematical handling,    |  
       math is a library to handle numberal operations                       |






#Q5.Access Spotify API & try to play some music & find some libraries

for album in albums:
